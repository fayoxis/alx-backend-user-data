#  ðŸ§®Basic Authentication

This project provides a hands-on approach to learning user authentication using the Basic Authentication scheme. By completing the tasks outlined below, you'll gain practical experience in setting up a basic API and testing it.

##  ðŸ§®Tasks to Complete

### 0. **Simple Basic API**

#### Setup and Start the Server

To get started, you need to install the necessary packages and launch the server. Follow these steps:

1. **Install Requirements:**
   Open your terminal and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

2. **Start the API Server:**
   Once the installation is complete, set the environment variables and start the server:

   You should see output indicating that the server is running, similar to this:

#### Using the API

With the server running, you can interact with the API. Open another terminal window or use your browser to send a request to the server.

1. **Check API Status:**
   Use the `curl` command to send a GET request to the `/api/v1/status` endpoint:

   The output will show the request details and the response from the server. You should see something like this:


### Summary

By completing this task, you will have successfully set up a simple API server and verified its functionality through a status check. This foundational knowledge is essential for understanding more complex authentication mechanisms and API development.
