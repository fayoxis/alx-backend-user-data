#  ðŸ§®Personal Data Protection Project

This project is designed to help you learn how to safeguard users' personal data through practical tasks.

## ðŸ§®Tasks to Complete

### ðŸ§®0. **Regular Expression Implementation**

In the file [filtered_logger.py](filtered_logger.py), you will find a function called `filter_datum`. This function is responsible for obfuscating log messages based on the following specifications:

#### ðŸ§®Function Requirements

- **Arguments:**
  - `fields`: A list of strings that specifies which fields in the log message should be obfuscated.
  - `redaction`: A string that defines the value used to replace the original content of the specified fields.
  - `message`: A string that represents the complete log line that contains all the fields.
  - `separator`: A string that indicates the character used to separate each field within the log line.

### ðŸ§®Learning Objectives

By completing this task, you will:
- Gain practical experience in using regular expressions for data obfuscation.
- Understand how to manipulate strings and handle log data effectively.
- Develop skills to enhance user privacy and data protection in software applications.
