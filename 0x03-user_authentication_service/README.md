# ðŸ§®User Authentication Service

This project is designed to provide a thorough understanding of creating a user authentication service using modern Python practices and libraries. It encompasses essential concepts such as user management, secure password handling, and session management.

## ðŸ§® Overview

The User Authentication Service will enable users to register, log in, and manage their authentication credentials securely. The project utilizes SQLAlchemy for database interactions, ensuring a robust data management layer while adhering to best practices in code style and security.

## ðŸ§®Requirements

To successfully run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **SQLAlchemy**: Version 1.3.x
  - A powerful SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for Python.
  
- **pycodestyle**: Version 2.5
  - A tool for checking compliance with PEP 8, the style guide for Python code.

- **bcrypt**: 
  - A library for hashing passwords securely to enhance user data protection.

- **Python**: Version 3.7
  - The programming language used for implementing the service.

## ðŸ§®Tasks to Complete

- [x] **User Model**  
  The file [user.py](user.py) includes a SQLAlchemy model named `User`, which maps to a database table designated as `users`. This model is constructed using the [mapping declaration](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/tutorial.html#declare-a-mapping) method provided by SQLAlchemy. The `User` model encompasses the following attributes:

  - **`id`**: 
    - Type: Integer
    - Description: Serves as the primary key for the `users` table, uniquely identifying each user.

  - **`email`**: 
    - Type: String
    - Description: A non-nullable field that stores the user's email address, which must be unique for each user. It serves as the primary identifier for user login.

  - **`hashed_password`**: 
    - Type: String
    - Description: A non-nullable field that stores the hashed version of the user's password. This field ensures that raw passwords are never stored in the database, thereby enhancing security.

  - **`session_id`**: 
    - Type: String (nullable)
    - Description: An optional field that holds the session identifier for the user. This is useful for managing user sessions and tracking active logins.

  - **`reset_token`**: 
    - Type: String (nullable)
    - Description: An optional field used for password reset functionality. This token is generated when a user requests to reset their password and is used to verify the user's identity during the reset process.

## ðŸ§®Additional Features to Consider

As you develop the User Authentication Service, consider implementing the following additional features:

- **User Registration**: 
  - Create an endpoint for new users to register by providing their email and password. Ensure that the email is validated and that passwords are hashed before storage.

- **User Login**: 
  - Implement a login mechanism that verifies user credentials and initiates a session.

- **Password Reset**: 
  - Provide functionality for users to reset their passwords, utilizing the `reset_token` for verification.

- **Session Management**: 
  - Develop a system to manage user sessions, allowing users to log out and ensuring that sessions time out after a period of inactivity.

- **Input Validation**: 
  - Incorporate input validation to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

- **Testing**: 
  - Write unit tests to ensure the reliability of the user authentication functionalities.

## ðŸ§®Conclusion

By completing this project, you will gain valuable experience in building a secure and efficient user authentication service. Youâ€™ll learn how to work with SQLAlchemy, enforce best coding practices, and implement essential security measures, all of which are crucial skills in modern software development.
